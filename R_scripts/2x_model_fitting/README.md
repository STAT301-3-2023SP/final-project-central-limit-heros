## Model Fitting Scripts

This sub-folder includes all information and code relevant for the model fitting process. Each script contains a definition of a recipe, model specification, initial tuning, and iterative search for hyperparameters through Bayesian Optimization methods where relevant.

Time data for fitting was also provided through the `tictoc` package and saved in a separate .rda file located in the `results` folder.
