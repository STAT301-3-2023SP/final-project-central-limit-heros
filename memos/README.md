# Project Reports

This file contains all relevant memos and reports, as quarto markdown documents and their rendered .html counterparts. The `images` subdirectory contains figures and headers used in these reports.

***NOTE:*** Although these files are nested away from the project directory, their execution will default to the main project directory, due to the `_quarto.yml` file in the main project directory specifying this behavior.
