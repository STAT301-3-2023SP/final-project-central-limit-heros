# outline:

## intro : sean talks about why gay people are cool

citations and such


## Data collection

we did a lot of work here lowkey . we should talk about it


## EDA 

did we just not have missingness?? i think there was some or else what are we imputing... lol.

DEFINITELY talk about the yeo johnson transform or whatever we did there. that was tea .

## Initial modeling

we fit these model types:

- Penalized Elastic Net Regression
    - with and without [partial least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression)

- Random Forest + Boosted Tree (?)

- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Neural Networks 
  - Basic neural networks using `nnet` in R
  - Using `keras` and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) from python through R
  
- Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines

- Cubist ensemble regression


***WHATS THE SITCH WITH OTHER RECIPES?? DO WE WANT TO TRY THEM NOW??***


## Model selection 

we picked the three best ones

## ensemble modeling

yay for stacks. we might actually want to try [baguette](https://baguette.tidymodels.org/index.html) instead, i feel like it slays, but i didnt do the reading so i owuldnt know.


## final results

happy pride <3 such a well timed project tbh
