## Prediction Project Outline

### Outcome Variable

Regression - predicting index scores
Include the link somewhere

Include density plot or histogram here, does it need to be transformed?

### Predictor Varialbes

Parks data - explanation for why this data is being used + link

Census data - explanation for why this data is being used + link

Housing data - explanation for why this data is being used + link

Missingness exploration here - plots + tables

### Issues and Challenges
Choosing the right predictors, how to capture as much of the variation as possible?

Housing data is quite large, number of observations to number predictors is suspiciously close, need to narrow down the predictors before fitting models, census data also to some extent

Missing data, needs to be imputed which may take some time for the machine to run

## Initial Steps

### Resampling
How many folds and repeats? V-fold probably?

### Recipes


### Model Types


### Comparison Metric
Probably RMSE?
